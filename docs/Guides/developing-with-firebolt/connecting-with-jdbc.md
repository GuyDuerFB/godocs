# JDBC driver
{:.no_toc}

Firebolt provides a [type 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JDBC_driver#Type_4_driver_%E2%80%93_Database-Protocol_driver/Thin_Driver(Pure_Java_driver)){:target="_blank"} JDBC driver to connect to Firebolt from Java applications. The driver is released as open source software using a permissive Apache 2 license and can be browsed, forked, downloaded, and contributed to through its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/firebolt-db/jdbc){:target="_blank"}.

* Topic toC

## Download the JAR file

The Firebolt JDBC driver is provided as a JAR file and requires [Java 11](https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp){:target="_blank"} or later. 

Download the Firebolt JDBC driver JAR file from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/firebolt-db/jdbc/releases){:target="_blank"}.

## Adding the Firebolt JDBC driver as a Maven dependency

If you are using Apache Maven, you can configure and build your projects to use the Firebolt JDBC driver to connect to your Firebolt resources. To do this, add the JDBC driver as a dependency in your project **pom.xml** file by including a link to the [Firebolt Maven repository](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.firebolt/firebolt-jdbc){:target="_blank"}.

See below for an example pom.xml file:

  {: .note}
  Be sure to replace `<version>3.1.0</version>` with the latest (highest) version number. You can identify the latest version by viewing the version history in the [Firebolt Maven Central repository](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.firebolt/firebolt-jdbc){:target="_blank"}.
    
    <!-- pom.xml  -->
    
    <project ...>
           <dependency>
                	<groupId>io.firebolt</groupId>
                	<artifactId>firebolt-jdbc</artifactId>
                	<version>3.1.0</version>
           </dependency>
    </project>


## Adding the Firebolt JDBC driver as a gradle dependency

  {: .note}
  Be sure to replace `<version>0.00</version>` with the latest (highest) version number. You can identify the latest version by viewing the version history in the [Firebolt Maven Central repository](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.firebolt/firebolt-jdbc){:target="_blank"}.

    /* build.gradle */
    
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    
    dependencies {
        implementation 'io.firebolt:firebolt-jdbc:3.0.1'
    }

## Connecting to Firebolt with the JDBC driver

Connection details are provided to the Firebolt JDBC driver in a connection string. The string has the following format:

    jdbc:firebolt:<database>?<connection_params>

`<database>`<br/>
The name of the Firebolt database to connect to.

`<connection_params>`<br/>
A list of connection parameters following the standard [URL query string format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string#Structure).

## Authentication

To authenticate, use a service account ID and secret.
A service account is identified by a `client_id` and a `client_secret`.
For compatibility with various external tools, `client_id` can be sent as `user` and `client_secret` as `password`.  
Learn how to generate an ID and secret [here](../managing-your-organization/service-accounts.md).

Here is an example of a connection details:

* URL that uses client_id/secret_id
  ```
    jdbc:firebolt:my_database?client_id=<client_id>&client_secret=<client_secret>&account=my_account&engine=my_database_general_purpose&buffer_size=1000000&connection_timeout_millis=10000
  ```

* URL that uses that omits authentication details that are passed in properties
  ```
  jdbc:firebolt:my_database?account=my_account&engine=my_database_general_purpose&buffer_size=1000000&connection_timeout_millis=10000`
  ```
  Connection properties:
  ```
  client_id=<client_id>
  client_secret=<client_secret>
  ```

* Minimal URL that sends all additional parameters in connection properties
  ```
  jdbc:firebolt:my_database
  ```
  Connection properties:
  ```
  client_id=<client_id>
  client_secret=<client_secret>
  account=my_account
  engine=my_database_general_purpose
  buffer_size=1000000
  connection_timeout_millis=10000
  ```

* Minimal URL that sends user and password (client_id and client_secret) using connection properties, omits engine name and therefore connects to default engine and relies on default values of other parameters
  ```
  jdbc:firebolt:my_database
  ```
  Connection properties:
  ```
  client_id=<client_id>
  client_secret=<client_secret>
  account=my_account
  ```

  {: .note}
  Since the connection string is a URI, make sure to [percent-encode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding){:target="_blank"} any reserved characters or special characters used in parameter keys or parameter values.

### Available connection parameters

The table below lists the available connection parameters that can be added to the Firebolt JDBC connection string. All parameter keys are case-sensitive.

### System settings as connection parameters

In addition to the parameters specified above, any [system setting](../../Reference/system-settings.md){:target="_blank"} can be passed as a connection string parameter. For example, if you wanted to set a custom time zone, your connection string would be as follows:
    
    jdbc:firebolt:my_database?time_zone=UTC&<other_connection_params>
    
## Applying system settings using SET

In addition to passing system settings as connection string parameters, any [system setting](../../Reference/system-settings.md){:target="_blank"} can be passed to Firebolt as a `SET` command in SQL. Multiple `SET` statements can be passed at once as long as they immediately follow one after another separated by semicolons, as shown in the following example.

    SET time_zone = 'UTC';
    SET standard_conforming_strings = false;
