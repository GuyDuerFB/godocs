Once you run out of credits, we recommend you connect Firebolt with your AWS Marketplace account and get back to making the most of Firebolt. See [Registering though AWS Marketplace](https://special-disco-436d3e6a.pages.github.io/Guides/getting-started.html#register-through-AWS-Marketplace) below.

## Create Your First Database and Engine
Embarking on your data journey with Firebolt begins with creating a *database* and selecting an *engine* tailored to your specific workload. An engine in Firebolt provides the compute resources dedicated to a database for executing tasks (see [Understanding Engines](https://special-disco-436d3e6a.pages.github.io/Overview/understanding-engine-fundamentals.html) to learn more). By default, every database starts with one general purpose engine capable of writing to the Firebolt file format (F3) for both data ingestion and analytics queries. For more information on using Firebolt engines, see [Working with engines](./working-with-engines/working-with-engines.md).

**Steps to Create Your Database:**
1. Click the **+** next to **Databases**

<img src="../assets/images/Create%20%2B%20(Highlighted).png" alt="New DB +" width="700"/>

2. Click **Create new database**. 

<img src="../assets/images/Create%20New%20DB%20From%20%2B.png" alt="New DB" width="700"/>

3. Enter the name for your database in the **Database Name** field. For the purposes of this guide, we'll use "Tutorial_Database" as our database name.

<img src="../assets/images/Tutorial%20DB.png" alt="New DB Name" width="700"/>

**Steps to Create Your Engine:**
1. Click the **+** next to **Databases** again.

<img src="../assets/images/Create%20%2B%20(Highlighted).png" alt="New Engine +" width="700"/>

2. Click **Create new engine**.

<img src="../assets/images/Create%20Engine%20%2B.png" alt="New Engine" width="700"/>

3. Enter the name of your engine in the **New engine name** field. For the purposes of this guide, we'll use "Tutorial_Engine" as our engine name.

The default configuration is a small node, which is more than enough for this tutorial. To learn more about proper sizing of nodes for your workload, see [ADD DOC REFERENCE]

## Execute Your First Query
Before we dive into ingesting sample data, let's familiarize ourselves with the SQL workspace of your database. This initial step not only demonstrates how to activate your engine but also acquaints you with the process of executing queries within Firebolt. For a deeper dive into the SQL workspace and its capabilities, our [Query Data](../query-data/using-the-sql-editor.md) guide is an excellent resource.

**Steps to Access Your Database, Activate the Engine, and Execute Your First Query:**
1. From the **Database page**, locate the database you've previously created ("Tutorial_Database"). Click the **Open in SQL workspace icon** (**>_**).

2. Upon entering the SQL workspace, you'll be greeted by the "Script 1" tab. This is where you'll craft your queries. To get started, enter the following simple query, designed to fetch a list of databases associated with your account:

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```  

3. Select **Run Script** to execute the query. You'll notice the **Using** dropdown menu, which displays the engine Firebolt employs to run your script. In this instance, it will indicate "Tutorial_Engine".

{: .note}
At this time, Firebolt may prompt you to initiate your engine if it's not already active. Select **Start Engine** to start your engine. Engine startup typically requires a few moments to complete, preparing your environment for data analysis.

By following these steps, you've not only executed your first query but also successfully set the stage for more advanced data exploration. This is just the beginning of what's possible with Firebolt - let's continue by adding some data. 

## Add Data To Your Database
Now that you can select databases, select engines, and run queries, let's add some sample data. For this tutorial we will explore adding data in two ways; 
1. Option 1: [Use `COPY FROM`](../sql_reference/commands/data-management/copy-from.md)
2. Option 2: [Creating and using an external table](#Creating-and-using-an-external-table)

{: .note}
This tutorial uses Firebolt's sample dataset, from the fictional gaming company "Ultra Fast Gaming Inc." This dataset is publicly available with the access credentials shared below.

### Option 1: Use COPY FROM 
`COPY FROM` allows you to copy data directly to a Firebolt table. For more information, see [COPY FROM](../sql_reference/commands/data-management/copy-from.md)

#### Step 1: Create a fact table
In this step, you'll create a Firebolt fact table called `tutorial`, which you use in the next step as the target for a `COPY FROM` command. 

1. Choose the plus symbol (**+**) next to **Script 1** to create a new script tab, **Script 2**, in the SQL workspace.
2. Copy and paste the query below into the **Script 2** tab.

```sql
CREATE FACT TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tutorial (
 LevelID INTEGER,
 GameID INTEGER,
 Level INTEGER,
 Name TEXT,
 LevelType TEXT,
 NextLevel INTEGER NULL,
 MinPointsToPass INTEGER,
 MaxPoints INTEGER, 
 NumberOfLaps INTEGER,
 MaxPlayers INTEGER,
 MinPlayers INTEGER,
 PointsPerLap REAL,
 MusicTrack TEXT,
 SceneDetails TEXT,
 MaxPlayTimeSeconds INTEGER,
 LevelIcon TEXT
);
```

#### Step 2: Use COPY FROM to ingest data
You can now use the `COPY FROM` command to copy the data from the S3 bucket into the fact table. During this operation, Firebolt ingests the data from your source into Firebolt.

1. Choose the plus symbol (**+**) next to **Script 2** to create a new script tab, **Script 3**, in the SQL workspace.
2. Copy and paste the query below into the **Script 3** tab.

```sql
COPY INTO tutorial FROM 's3://firebolt-publishing-public/help_center_assets/firebolt_sample_dataset/';
```

{: .note}
Since we are accessing a publicly accessible datset, you do not need to specify the credentials for this tutorial. 

#### Step 3: Query the ingested data
To verify that you inserted the data into the table, run a simple `SELECT` query like the one below.

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  tutorial
```

And that's it! You've successfully copied data from S3 into a Firebolt table. 

### Option 2: Create and use an external table
#### Step 1: Create an External Table
An *external table* is a special, virtual table that serves as a connector to your data source. After the external table is created, you ingest data by running an `INSERT` command from that external table into a *fact table* or *dimension table*. The `INSERT` command must run on a general purpose engine. After the data is available in fact and dimension tables, you can run analytics queries over those tables using any engine. 

{: .note}
Although it's possible, we don't recommend running analytics queries on external tables. For more information on working with external tables, see [Work with external tables](../Guides/loading-data/working-with-external-tables.html). FOr more information on fact tables, see [Working with tables](..Guides/loading-data/working-with-external-tables.html)

**Create Your External Table:**
1. Choose the plus symbol (**+**) next to script tab to create a new script tab in the SQL workspace.

<img src="../assets/images/New%20Script%20%2B.png" alt="New Script" width="600"/>

2. Copy and paste the query below into the new tab.

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ex_levels (
-- Column definitions map to data fields
-- in the source data file and are specified
-- as sources in the INSERT INTO statement for ingestion. 
    LevelID INTEGER,
    GameID INTEGER,
    Level INTEGER,
    Name TEXT,
    LevelType TEXT,
    NextLevel INTEGER NULL,
    MinPointsToPass INTEGER,
    MaxPoints INTEGER, 
    NumberOfLaps INTEGER,
    MaxPlayers INTEGER,
    MinPlayers INTEGER,
    PointsPerLap REAL,
    MusicTrack TEXT,
    SceneDetails TEXT,
    MaxPlayTimeSeconds INTEGER,
    LevelIcon TEXT
) 

URL = 's3://firebolt-publishing-public/help_center_assets/firebolt_sample_dataset/'

-- CREDENTIALS = ( AWS_KEY_ID = '******' AWS_SECRET_KEY = '******' )
OBJECT_PATTERN = 'help_center_assets/firebolt_sample_dataset/levels.csv'
TYPE = (CSV SKIP_HEADER_ROWS = 1);
```  

{: .note} 
'URL =' specifies the data source in S3. All files in the location that match the 'OBJECT_PATTERN' and will be processed during ingestion. 'CREDENTIALS =' specify a role or AWS key credentials with permission to read from the S3 location. Since we are accessing a publicly accessible bucket, we do not need to specify credentials for this tutorial.

3. Click **Run**. When completed the external table `ex_levels` appears on the object panel of the database.  

<img src="../assets/images/Execute%20Script%20(Run)%20Example.png" alt="Script Run" width="600"/>

4. [Optional] Choose the vertical ellipses next to script, choose **Rename script**, enter a name (for example, *MyExTableScript*) and then press ENTER to update the name.

<img src="../assets/images/Vertical%20Ellipsis.png" alt="Vertical Ellipsis" width="600"/>

<img src="../assets/images/Rename%20Script.png" alt="Rename" width="600"/>

#### Step 2: Create a Fact Table
In this step, you'll create a Firebolt fact table called `levels`, which you use in the next step as the target for an `INSERT INTO` command. 

When creating a fact or dimension table, you will specify a *primary index*. Firebolt uses the primary index when it ingests data so that it is saved to S3 for highly efficient pruning and sorting when the data is queried. A primary index is required when creating a fact table, and recommended for dimension tables. For more information, see [Using primary indexes](./working-with-indexes/using-primary-indexes.md). 

The fact table that we create in this step specifies the `LevelID` column for the primary index. For more information about choosing columns for a primary index, see [How to choose primary index columns](/using-indexes/using-primary-indexes.md#how-to-choose-primary-index-columns).

**To create a fact table**
1. Create a new script tab.  

2. Copy and paste the query below into the script tab.  
```sql
CREATE FACT TABLE IF NOT EXISTS levels
(
 LevelID INTEGER,
 GameID INTEGER,
 Level INTEGER,
 Name TEXT,
 LevelType TEXT,
 NextLevel INTEGER NULL,
 MinPointsToPass INTEGER,
 MaxPoints INTEGER, 
 NumberOfLaps INTEGER,
 MaxPlayers INTEGER,
 MinPlayers INTEGER,
 PointsPerLap REAL,
 MusicTrack TEXT,
 SceneDetails TEXT,
 MaxPlayTimeSeconds INTEGER,
 LevelIcon TEXT,
 SOURCE_FILE_NAME TEXT,
 SOURCE_FILE_TIMESTAMP TIMESTAMP
) 
PRIMARY INDEX LevelID;
```  

3. Click **Run Script**. When finished, the table `levels` appears on the object panel of the database.  

#### Step 3: Use INSERT INTO to ingest data
You can now use the `INSERT INTO` command to copy the data from the external table into the fact table. During this operation, Firebolt ingests the data from your source into Firebolt.

**To run an `INSERT` command that ingests data**
1. Create a new script tab.
2. Copy and paste the query below into the script tab.  
```sql
INSERT INTO levels
SELECT
 LevelID,
 GameID,
 Level,
 Name,
 LevelType,
 NextLevel,
 MinPointsToPass,
 MaxPoints, 
 NumberOfLaps,
 MaxPlayers,
 MinPlayers,
 PointsPerLap,
 MusicTrack,
 SceneDetails,
 MaxPlayTimeSeconds,
 LevelIcon,
 $SOURCE_FILE_NAME, 
 $SOURCE_FILE_TIMESTAMP
FROM ex_levels;
```
3. Choose **Run Script**
Click **Run** to execut the script.

<img src="../assets/images/Run%20INSERT.png" alt="Run INSERT" width="600"/>

The query results pane indicates a **Status** of **Running** when the query is executing. The **Status** will change to **Success** when the ingestion is complete as shown below.

<img src="../assets/images/Query%20Status.png" alt="ScriptSucceed" width="600"/>

#### Step 4: Query the ingested data
Now that the data has been ingested into the `levels` table, you can run analytics queries over the table that benefit from the speed and efficiency of Firebolt.

To verify that you inserted the data into the table, run a simple `SELECT` query like the one below.

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  levels
```
The values shown in the query results pane should be similar to those shown below.

<img src="../assets/images/Results%20Pane.png" alt="ResultsPane" width="600"/>


## Next Steps
Now that you have successfully created your first engine and database in Firebolt, run your first query, and copied data to Firebolt you can start exploring what else Firebolt has to offer! Below are a few examples to get you started. 

### Register through AWS Marketplace
This registration is a prerequisite for starting engines and running queries after your initial trial credits. 

**To register**
1. On the [Firebolt page](https://go.firebolt.io/), navigate to the **Configuration menu**. Click **Billing**. 

2. Click **Connect to AWS Marketplace**. This will take you to the Firebolt page available on AWS Marketplace.

3. On the AWS Marketplace page, click the **View Purchase Options** on the top right hand corner of the screen. 
 
4. Click **Setup Your Account**. 

Your account should now be associated with AWS Marketplace. 


### Configure an aggregating index
An aggregating index enables you to take a subset of table columns and predefine dimensions and measures to aggregate. Many aggregations are supported&mdash;from `SUM`, `MAX`, and `MIN` to more complex aggregations such as `COUNT` and `COUNT(DISTINCT)`. At query runtime, instead of calculating the aggregation on the entire table and scanning all rows, Firebolt uses the pre-calculated values in the aggregating index. For more information, see [Aggregating indexes](./working-with-indexes/using-aggregating-indexes.md).

From the `levels` fact table that you created in the previous step, assume you want to run a query to look at the `AVG(NumberOfLaps)`, grouped by `LevelType`. You can create an aggregating index to speed up these queries by running the statement below.

```sql
CREATE AGGREGATING INDEX
  levels_agg_idx
ON levels (
  LevelType 
  , AVG(NumberOfLaps)
  );
```

After you run the script, you see the `levels_agg_idx` index listed in the object pane. Any queries that run over the `levels` table that combine any of these fields and aggregations defined in the index will now use the index instead of reading the entire table.

<img src="../assets/images/AggIndex.png" alt="AggIndex" width="500"/>

### Use COPY TO to export data to S3
The example below shows a `COPY TO` statement with minimal parameters that specifies an `AWS_ROLE_ARN`. Because `TYPE` is omitted, the file or files will be written in CSV format, and because `COMPRESSION` is omitted, they are compressed using GZIP  (`*.csv.gz`).

```sql
COPY (SELECT * FROM test_table)
  TO 's3://my_bucket/my_fb_queries'
  CREDENTIALS = (AWS_ROLE_ARN='arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-firebolt-role');
```

Firebolt assigns the query ID `16B903C4206098FD` to the query at runtime. The compressed output is 40 MB, exceeding the default of 16 MB, so Firebolt writes 4 files as shown below.

```bash
s3://my_bucket/my_fb_queries/
  16B903C4206098FD_0.csv.gz
  16B903C4206098FD_1.csv.gz
  16B903C4206098FD_2.csv.gz
  16B903C4206098FD_3.csv.gz
```
See [COPY TO](https://special-disco-436d3e6a.pages.github.io/sql_reference/commands/data-management/copy-to.html) for more information.
