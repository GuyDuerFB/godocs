## DB version 3.31
**February 2024**

* [New features](#new-features)
* [Enhancements, changes, and new integrations](#enhancements-changes-and-new-integrations)
* [Resolved issues](#resolved-issues)

### New features

<!--- FIR-22307 --->**PG compliant division**

LQP2 has a new division operator that is PG compliant, by default. This is a breaking change. 

<!--- FIR-29179 --->**Prevents usage of new line delimeter for schema inference**

An error will now occur if schema inference is used with the option “delimiter” set to something other than the default. 

### Enhancements, changes and new integrations

<!--- FIR-29747 --->**Disabled Unix Time Functions**

The following functions are not supported anymore:
* 'from_unixtime'
* 'to_unix_timestamp'
* 'to_unix_time'
This is a breaking change. 

<!--- FIR-27548 --->**Simplified table protobuf representation**

Unique constraints in tables will be blocked for new accounts.

<!--- FIR-29729 --->**Renamed spilled metrics columns**

The columns `spilled_bytes_uncompressed` and `spilled_bytes_compressed` of `information_schema.query_history` have been replaced by a single column [`spilled_bytes`](../../sql_reference/information-schema/query-history-view.md). It contains the amount of data that was spilled to disk temporarily while executing the query.

<!--- FIR-27799 --->**Updated AWS billing error message**

The error message for an AWS billing issue on Engine Start was on Engine Start was changed to add more information and clarity.  

<!--- FIR-28276 --->**New requirements updated for EXPLAIN**

For [`EXPLAIN`](../../sql_reference/commands/queries/explain.md) queries, we now allow only one of the following options at the same time: `ALL`, `LOGICAL`, `PHYSICAL`, `ANALYZE`.`EXPLAIN (ALL)` now returns the plans in multiple rows instead of multiple columns.

<!--- FIR-29536 --->**Aggregating index placement**

Aggregating index is now placed in the same namespace as tables and views. This is a breaking change. 

<!--- FIR-29225 --->**Syntax and planner support for LATERAL scoping**

[LATERAL](../reserved-words.md) is now a reserved keyword. It must now be used within double-quotes when using it as an object identifier. This is a breaking change. 

<!--- FIR-25080 --->**Spilling Joins Processing**

Firebolt can now process inner and outer joins that exceed the available main memory of the engine by spilling to the the SSD cache when needed. This happens transparently to the user. A query that made use of this capability will populate the `spilled_bytes` column in `information_schema.query_history`.

### Resolved issues

<!--- FIR-21152 --->
* Changed return for division by 0 from null to fail. This is a breaking change. 

<!--- FIR-18709 --->
* Updated error log for upload failure for clarity.

<!--- FIR-29147 --->
* Fixed a bug in 'unnest' table function that occurred when not all of the 'unnest' columns were projected.

<!--- FIR-28187 --->
* Changed the behavior of [`split_part'](../../sql_reference/functions-reference/string/split-part.md) when an empty string is used as delimiter.

<!--- FIR-28623 --->
* Fixed a bug where floating point values `-0.0` and `+0.0`, as well as `-nan` and `+nan` were not considered equal in distributed queries.

<!--- FIR-29759 --->
* 'TRY_CAST' from 'TEXT' to 'NUMERIC' now works as expected: if the value cannot be parsed as 'NUMERIC' it produces null.
