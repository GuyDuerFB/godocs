# Object identifers

Firebolt identifiers can refer to the following items:

* Columns
* Tables
* Indexes
* Databases
* Views
* Engines

## Syntax

Identifiers must contain at least one character, and no more than 255.

Unquoted identifiers must adhere to the following syntax:

1. The first character must be a letter (a-z), underscore (_).
2. After the first character, subsequent characters can be letters, underscores, digits (0-9).

Qouted identifiers can contain any UTF-8 letter of the following:

1. Any letter in any language, as represented by the Unicode regular expression [\p{L}](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/#General_Category_Values).
2. Any numeric character in any language as represented by the Unicode regular expression [\p{N}](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/#General_Category_Values).
3. Hyphen or dash, as represented by the Unicode regular expression [\p{Pd}](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/#General_Category_Values).
4. Underscores, as represented by the Unicode regular expression [\p{Pc}](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/#General_Category_Values).

## Unquoted identifiers

Firebolt evaluates unquoted identifiers such as table and column names entirely in lowercase. The following queries:

```
SELECT my_column FROM my_table
SELECT MY_COLUMN FROM MY_TABLE
SELECT mY_cOlUmn FROM mY_tAbLe
```

are all equivalent to:

```
SELECT my_column FROM my_table
```

{: .note}
Unquoted identifiers in some early Firebolt accounts may be case sensitive.


You can keep uppercase identifiers by enclosing them in double-quotes. For example, the following identifiers are unique:

```
"COLUMN_NAME"
"column_name"
"CoLuMn_NaMe"
```
