If you're adding a new SQL function (aggregate, scalar, or table-valued), check this link providing guidelines on what information we're interested in including in docs :
https://github.com/firebolt-analytics/firebolt-docs-staging/blob/gh-pages/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/new-function-template.md
Then go over the following steps :
1. Preview your documentation locally using this tutorial: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll
2. Validate that indexing works and that youâ€™re able to navigate to the documentation page from the table of content
3. Make sure that the function was added to the function glossary
Note that the first step will be needed only until we have preview automation in the CI


For other changes (not SQL functions additions) follow those steps:
1. Preview your  documentation locally using this tutorial: : https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll
2. Validate  that indexing works and that you're able to navigate to the documentation page from the table of content
Note that the first step will be needed only until we have preview automation in the CI
