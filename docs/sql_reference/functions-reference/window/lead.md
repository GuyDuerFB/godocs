| Parameter | Description                                      | Supported input types | 
| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------ | :------------| 
| `<expression>`     | Any valid expression that will be returned based on the `<offset>.`                                                    | Any |
| `<partition_by>`    | The expression used for the `PARTITION BY` clause.                                                                           | Any |
| `<offset>`  | The number of rows forward from the current row from which to obtain a value.  |	`INTEGER` |

## Example
{: .no_toc}

In the example below, the `LAG `function is being used to find the players in each level who ranked above and below a certain player. In some cases, if the player has no one ranked above or below them, the `LEAD` function returns `NULL`.

```sql
SELECT
	nickname,
	level,
	LEAD(nickname, -1) OVER (PARTITION BY level ORDER BY nickname ) AS rank_above,
	LEAD(nickname, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY level ORDER BY nickname ) AS rank_below
FROM
	players;
```

**Returns**:

| nickname | level | rank_above | rank_below |
|:----------|:-------------|:-------------|:--------------|
| kennethpark      |           9 | NULL        | rileyjon     |
| rileyjon   |           9 | kennethpark       | sabrina21         |
| sabrina21       |           9 | rileyjon    | ymatthews         |
| ymatthews      |           9 | sabrina21       | NULL         |
