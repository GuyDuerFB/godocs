# Information schema

The Firebolt information schema consists of a set of system views that contain metadata information on the objects defined in the current database. In addition, it contains a set of database usage views such as the [query history](../information-schema/engine-query-history.md) and [running queries](../information-schema/engine-running-queries.md). The Firebolt information schema relies on the standard SQL information schema with some additional information and views that are specific to Firebolt.
